<b>Default cryptocurrency bot that works with Binance API</b><br>

  <li>If you are a new user, you will get 100$ to test my crypto exchange.</li>
  <li>To help you, I created a “/help” command that should explain what each button means.</li>
  <li>If you do not know the abbreviated names of the coins, click on the STATS Crypto button, and if you know the name of the coin, but want to know the price, you need to click on the FIND Crypto button.</li>
  <li>If you want to see your profile, balance of coins or assets - press the SHOW Crypto key. </li>
  <li>There are two buttons for buying/selling coins - BUY/SELL Crypto. When you click the buy button, you will need to enter the name of the cryptocurrency and its amount to buy.</li>
